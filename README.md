# ivar
iVar is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing. This fork contained a reduced and modified edition of the consensus pipeline.

This fork contains a reduced repository, only containing the pipeline that we use for our SARS-CoV-2 illumina-sequencing in Region Midtjylland.

We have modified/optimized the pipeline to work on batches of qiaseq/twist miseq sequencing libraries.
